# Automation to Install 3CX with Ansible 

I am going to install 3CX automatically in the  **VMWARE vCenter**  from **Debian 12 Template**, in this case I made a run.sh, with bash script to play:

 1. create-3cx-vm.yml
 2. set-root-password.yml
 3. install-3cx.yml
 We should edit the vars.yml and hosts to make the playbooks run correctly.
 
## Requirements
We should install the requirements which is in the requirement.txt
